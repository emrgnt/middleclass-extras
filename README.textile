h1. middleclass-extras

This is a set of additions to "middleclass":http://www.github.org/kikito/middleclass.

h1. Module brief description

What follows is a brief description of each of the middleclass-extras modules. Each nodule is commented out with usage examples. You can find more examples on the /spec/ folder.

* *Invoker* is a very small mixin that can be used to 'send' methods to instances. It's main advantage is that it accepts both method names and lua functions on its parameters.
* *GetterSetter* just adds a couple convenience getXXX, setXXX methods to your class.
* *Beholder* is a small signaling/event controller mixin. Your classes can 'observe' and 'stop observing' events. Note that *Invoker* must be required before *Beholder*, or the later will not work.
* *Callbacks* is a powerful mixin that allows you to add 'hooks' to any existing method. For example, you can specify on runtime that you want to call a method after initializing one object.
* *Stateful* defines stateful objects. Classes receive a new method called @addState@, and instances receive a new method called @gotoState@. The behaviour of each of the instance methods can be redefined per-state.
* *Branchy* defines some useful methods for classes that behave like trees (@addChild@, @getAncestors@, etc)

h1. Installation

Note that middleclass-extras does *not* includes middleclass (this has changed from previous versions).

In order to download middleclass-extras using git, it is very recommendable that you download middleclass and middleclass-extras:

<pre>
  git clone git://github.com/kikito/middleclass.git
  git clone git://github.com/kikito/middleclass-extras.git
</pre>

h2. Usage

middleclass-extras is prepared to be required right after middleclass:

<pre>
  require('middleclass.init')
  require('middleclass-extras.init')
</pre>

Notes:
* You can remove the .init part from middleclass if you are using middleclass as a file (middleclass.lua) instead of as a dir (middleclass/)
* You can remove the .init part on both requires if your package.path setting already includes init.lua
* The package assumes that it will be placed on a directory whose parent is included on the path. Normally, putting it on the 'root' of your project should work. Otherwise, you will have to modify your @package.path@ variable so includes the 'parent folder' inmediately above of middleclass-extras.
For example, if middleclass-extras is inside a directory called @libs@, you must do:

<pre>
package.path = 'libs/?;libs/?.lua;' .. package.path
</pre>
