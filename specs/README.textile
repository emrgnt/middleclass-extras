h1. middleclass-extras specs

These specs have been implemented using "telescope":http://github.com/norman/telescope

They are a series of tests that ensure that middleclass-extras works as expected. It is recommended to run them after making any modifications on middleclass-extras (or middleclass).

h2. Installing dependencies for the tests

First step is installing telescope. The easiest way to do that in ubuntu is by installing luarocks first:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install lua luarocks
sudo luarocks build telescope --from=http://luarocks.luaforge.net/rocks-cvs/
</pre>

The first command might ask about installing some dependencies; answer (y)es to that.

h2. Specs execution

Open a console and change to the middleclass-extras top-directory:

<pre>
cd middleclass-extras
</pre>

Then execute @specs/run.lua@. It should be configured to start the testing automatically.
<pre>
specs/run.lua
</pre>

If everything has been set up properly, you should see lost of testing being done, and, hopefully, passing.
