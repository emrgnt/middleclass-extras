h1. middleclass-extras tests

These tests have been implemented using "telescope":http://github.com/norman/telescope


h2. Installing dependencies for the tests

First step is installing telescope. The easiest way in ubuntu is doing:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install lua luarocks
sudo luarocks build telescope --from=http://luarocks.luaforge.net/rocks-cvs/
</pre>

The first command might ask about installing some dependencies; answer (y)es to that.

In addition to this, you will need rake.
<pre>
sudo apt-get install rake
</pre>

Again, install any dependencies.

h2. Test execution

Open a console and change to the middleclass-extras top-directory:

<pre>
cd middleclass-extras
cd specs
</pre>

Then execute @rake@. It should be configured to start the testing automatically.
<pre>
rake
</pre>

If everything has been set up properly, you should see lost of testing being done, and, hopefully, passing.
